## Purpose

The **Renewal Cost Report** is a forward-looking asset planning tool that forecasts capital renewal costs over a defined period (default 20 years). It helps organizations:

* Predict future renewal and replacement costs
* Optimize capital expenditure planning
* Prioritize assets based on risk and remaining service potential

This report is especially useful for strategic planning, budget justification, and aligning renewal needs with funding availability.

## Methodology

### Renewal Timing

* **Condition-Based**: Uses condition score + profile mapping to estimate remaining life
* **Age-Based**: Uses acquisition date + standard useful life
* **Manual Override**: Allows planners to specify known renewal years

### Renewal Cost

* Based on **Replacement Cost** from current valuation
* Optional inflation/contingency adjustments
* Allows technology uplift/upgrade cost factors

## Business Context

The report aligns with strategic asset planning needs such as:

* Long-term infrastructure planning (10–50 years)
* 10-year maintenance forecasting (legacy feature extension)
* Capital budget modeling by class or portfolio

> "Projected renewals report" — as referenced in legacy documentation — is a key output of this tool.

## Report Generation Workflow

1. **Load Data**: Asset + valuation + component + profile data
2. **Calculate Renewals**: Estimate year, cost, and group by priority
3. **Aggregate**: Summarize by year and asset class
4. **Build Excel File**:

   * Multi-tab workbook
   * Charts and pivot tables
   * Styled sheets for export and printing
