## Purpose

The **Insurance Valuation Report** supports insurance planning by providing accurate estimates for both **replacement cost** and **indemnity value** per asset and component. It's used by valuers, asset managers, and finance teams to:

* Inform insurance policies and renewal discussions
* Assess coverage levels across asset classes
* Track insurance-related assumptions and methodologies

## Generation Workflow

### Process Stages

1. **Data Load**: Retrieve asset/component data and assumptions
2. **Filtering**: Apply job and class-based constraints
3. **Calculation**:

   * Compute replacement and indemnity values
   * Group and summarize results
4. **Excel Report Generation**:

   * Format worksheets with data and visuals
   * Insert formulas and headers
5. **Delivery**:

   * Serve via API or file container
