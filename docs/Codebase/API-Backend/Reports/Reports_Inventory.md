# Report Generators Inventory

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive inventory of all **report generators** in the Asset Valuer Pro (AVP) system. These generators follow the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern and are implemented as query handlers.

The goal is to:

* Help developers navigate and maintain report logic
* Support documentation and testing efforts
* Aid in understanding how reports are structured and where they reside

## Priority Reports (For Documentation & Development Focus)

Based on business value and system complexity, the following reports should be prioritized for documentation, testing, and customization:

1. **Summary Valuation Report** – Core output used by clients and executives
2. **Methodology Report** – Audit-critical explanation of valuation logic
3. **Changes Report** – Comparison of valuations across timeframes
4. **Renewal Cost Report** – Strategic for capital planning
5. **Stratification Summary Report** – Used for high-level asset group analysis
