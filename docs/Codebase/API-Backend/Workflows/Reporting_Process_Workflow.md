# Reporting Process Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the **reporting workflow** in **Asset Valuer Pro (AVP)**, covering how reports are triggered, generated, formatted, stored, and delivered. It is designed for:

* Engineers integrating reporting logic
* QA teams verifying report generation
* Analysts preparing outputs for clients

> **Objective**: Translate valuation data into standardized outputs across financial, insurance, asset management, and audit contexts.

---

## Business Context

Reporting is a critical final phase in AVPâ€™s valuation lifecycle. Reports serve business needs such as:

* Financial disclosures (IFRS/AASB/IPSAS compliance)
* Insurance valuation summaries
* Asset renewal planning and lifecycle forecasting
* Audit trail creation and peer review

## Reporting Workflow Stages

### Step 1: Data Validation

* Check required fields are populated
* Validate updated calculations
* Ensure consistency in asset records

ðŸ”§ Technical:

* `AssetController.cs`
* Frontend validation in `ReportingPage.tsx`
* Validator logic for calculation status and missing fields

### Step 2: Report Type Selection

* User selects report type and parameters (e.g., Job ID, Asset Class)
* Triggers backend generation

ðŸ”§ Technical:

* `Reporting.tsx` (UI)
* `ReportsController.cs` (API layer)

### Step 3: Report Generation

* Fetch required valuation, asset, and metadata
* Transform data into report schema
* Use builder tools (e.g., ExcelFileBuilder)

ðŸ”§ Key components:

* `ReportCalculationService.cs`
* `/Application/Reports/Queries/...`
* `ExcelFileBuilder.cs`, `IDocumentBuilderService.cs`

### Step 4: Storage & Delivery

* Reports saved to blob storage
* Metadata indexed by job and type
* UI/API for download access

ðŸ”§ Components:

* `ReportList.tsx`
* BlobStorage/CloudFileService backend
