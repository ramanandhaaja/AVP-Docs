## Purpose & Role

The `AssetClass` entity is the **foundational tier** in the asset classification hierarchy. It enables:

* Grouping of assets by macro category (e.g., Buildings, Roads, Parks)
* Standardization of valuation rules and expectations at the class level
* Association with a specific valuation job (`JobId`) for data isolation and snapshotting

> This hierarchy supports structured valuation workflows and reporting.

## Classification Hierarchy

The full asset structure hierarchy is:

1. **AssetClass** – e.g., Buildings
2. **AssetType** – e.g., Commercial Buildings
3. **AssetSubType** – e.g., Office Space, Warehouse

This system allows:

* Logical organization of all assets
* Application of tailored valuation logic per group
* Aggregation in financial reporting by class

---

## Business Context

### Why It Matters

* Financial regulations often require disclosures by asset class
* Different asset classes require different valuation methods (e.g., cost vs. market approach)
* Components expected for an asset often depend on its class (e.g., roofs for buildings, pavements for roads)

### Use in Valuation

* When a `Job` is linked to an `AssetClass`, it triggers asset valuation logic
* `ValuationProfileRules` define how to evaluate asset types within this class
* Classes provide a default grouping mechanism for clients with unique taxonomies

---

## Business Rules

* Every `AssetClass` **must be linked** to a `Job` for it to be included in a valuation cycle
* Valuation events are initiated automatically when a `Job` is assigned
* Client-specific logic allows for tailored classification schemes per organization

| Property          | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Namespace**     | `AVP.Domain.Entities`                                             |
| **Inheritance**   | `Lookup`, `IClientEntity`                                         |
| **Core Behavior** | Supports client-level lookup flexibility and classification reuse |

## Performance Considerations

Asset classes are frequently referenced in:

* Filtering assets for valuation
* Aggregating totals by class in reports

> **Optimization Tip:** Index the `AssetClassId` and `JobId` columns for high-performance querying, especially in large portfolios.
