## Usage in the Valuation Lifecycle

### 1. **Calculation Phase**

AssetValuation records are created/updated when the valuer initiates calculation processes in a valuation job.

> "Once all data is populated the valuer refreshes all the calculations..."

### 2. **Reporting Phase**

Values stored in AssetValuation are used in:

* Financial reports (e.g., balance sheet)
* Insurance summaries
* Depreciation schedules

> "...used to produce various reports covering financial reporting and insurance."

### 3. **Archiving & Audit Trail**

Completed valuations are preserved with historical context when the job is archived.

> "Job status is changed to 'archived'... data recorded as 'previous years' figures."

## Valuation Methodologies

| Method           | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `CostApproach`   | Based on replacement cost adjusted for depreciation |
| `MarketApproach` | Based on recent comparable sales data               |
| `IncomeApproach` | Based on capitalized future income streams          |

The selected method governs how financial fields like `CurrentValue` and `DepreciableAmount` are calculated.

## Business Context

The `AssetValuation` model provides core values required for:

* IFRS & IPSAS compliance
* Asset management planning
* Insurance benchmarking
* Capital budgeting & lifecycle cost tracking

It is referenced by:

* `AssetController` for recalculation workflows
* `ReportsController` for generating output
* Valuation Job workflows for structured processing

## Technical Design

| Property       | Value                 |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| **Namespace**  | `AVP.Domain.Entities` |
| **Base Class** | `AuditableEntity`     |

---

## Performance Considerations

* AssetValuation records are only created when calculations are explicitly run
* Recommended query filters: `JobId`, `AssetId`, `EffectiveDate`
* Ensure proper indexing on `AssetId`, `JobId`, `EffectiveDate`

> **Tip:** Batch querying by job and projecting only key financial fields improves report generation efficiency.
